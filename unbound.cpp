/*
Given a function int f(unsigned int x) which takes a non-negative integer x as input and returns an integer as output.
The function is monotonically increasing with respect to value of x, i.e., the value of f(x+1) is greater than f(x) for
every input x. Find the value 'n' where f() becomes positive for the first time. Since f() is monotonically increasing,
values of f(n+1), f(n+2),Â¿ must be positive and values of f(n-2), f(n-3), .. must be negative.

Find n in O(logn) time, you may assume that f(x) can be evaluated in O(1) time for any input x.
