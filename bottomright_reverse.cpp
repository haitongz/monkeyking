/*
Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points i.e, zero points.
We can move across a cell only if we have positive points. Whenever we pass through a cell,
points in that cell are added to our overall points. We need to find minimum initial points to
reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).

Constraints :
From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.

Input: points[m][n] = {{-2,  -3,  3},
                       {-5, -10,  1},
                       {10,  30, -5}};
Output: 7

Explanation:
7 is the minimum value to reach destination with positive throughout the path. Below is the path.

(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)

We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach(0, 1) with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2)
with 6 and finally we have 1 point (we needed greater than 0 points at the end).
