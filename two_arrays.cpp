/*
The problem can be solved in O(nLogn + mLogn) time. The trick here is, if y > x then x^y > y^x with some exceptions. Following are simple steps based on this trick.

1) Sort array Y[].
2) For every x in X[], find the index idx of smallest number greater than x (also called ceil of x) in Y[] using binary search or we can use the inbuilt function upper_bound() in algorithm library.
3) All the numbers after idx satisfy the relation so just add (n-idx) to the count.

Base Cases and Exceptions:
Following are exceptions for x from X[] and y from Y[]
If x = 0, then the count of pairs for this x is 0.
If x = 1, then the count of pairs for this x is equal to count of 0s in Y[].
The following cases must be handled separately as they donÂ¿t follow the general rule that x smaller than y means x^y is greater than y^x.
a) x = 2, y = 3 or 4
b) x = 3, y = 2
Note that the case where x = 4 and y = 2 is not there

    // x^Y[i] > Y[i]^x

    // If x is 1, then the number of pais is equal to number of
    // zeroes in Y[]
    if (x == 1) return NoOfY[0];

    // Find number of elements in Y[] with values greater than x
    // upper_bound() gets address of first greater element in Y[0..n-1]
    int* idx = upper_bound(Y, Y + n, x);
    int ans = (Y + n) - idx;

    // If we have reached here, then x must be greater than 1,
    // increase number of pairs for y=0 and y=1

    // Increase number of pairs for x=3 and y=2
